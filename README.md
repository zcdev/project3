# Passport and MERN Boilerplate

Setting up your project can be one of the most tedious and time consuming aspects of programming. Errors can pop up left and right and you can often feel like you aren't writing any sort of creative code.

Using this MERN boilerplate skips that whole process. If you don't know, MERN stand for Mongo, Express, React and Node. If you've made an app with this stack before, you'll know that this process can be trickier than it seems... 

On top of being a MERN stack boilerplate, this app also include Passport.js authentication. Almost every app has unique users. Creating an app that securely authenticates users can be somewhat of a challenge. We've got you covered their. This boilerplate creates new users, and then maintains their session until they manually log out.

Enjoy!
